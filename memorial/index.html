                <h2>History of the Rwandan Genocide</h2>
                <p>The Rwandan Genocide, also known as the Rwandan Massacre, was a period of ethnic violence and mass killings that took place in Rwanda from April to July 1994.</p>
                <p>The violence was sparked by the assassination of the Rwandan president, Juv√©nal Habyarimana, on April 6, 1994, by members of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), a rebel group based in neighboring Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo). The Hutu-led government of Rwanda blamed the RPF for the president's death and launched a campaign of mass killings against the Tutsi minority.</p>
                <p>The Rwandan Genocide was the deadliest in a century, with an estimated 800,000 people killed in the first 100 days. The violence was not just about ethnicity - it was also about power and control. The Hutu-led government used propaganda and violence to eliminate any perceived or real threat to their rule, including the Tutsi minority who made up only 10% of the population.</p>
                <p>The violence spread throughout the country, with Hutu extremists killing an estimated one million people, mostly Tutsis, and a significant number of moderate Hutus who were considered "co-responsible" for the assassination. The Tutsi minority was subjected to systematic killings, forced displacement, and sexual violence. The Hutu-led government also established "hutuization" programs to promote Hutu culture and language.</p>
                <p>The international community was largely ineffective in preventing the genocide, with many countries failing to act when they had the opportunity. The United Nations Security Council voted to impose sanctions on Rwanda in response to the violence, but the sanctions were not enforced.</p>

                <h2>Impact of the Rwandan Genocide</h2>
                <p>The Rwandan Genocide had a profound impact on the Rwandan people and the world as a whole.</p>
                <p>The genocide resulted in the deaths of over 800,000 people, with estimates suggesting that up to one million people may have died.</p>
                <p>The displacement of millions of people, both internally and outside of Rwanda, has been a lasting impact on the country.</p>
                <p>The international community's response to the genocide was inadequate, with many countries failing to act when they had the opportunity.</p>
                <p>The genocide also had a significant impact on international relations, with tensions between Rwanda and neighboring countries remaining high for many years after the conflict.</p>

                <h2>Remembering the Rwandan Genocide</h2>
                <p>The Rwandan Genocide Memorial is a monument dedicated to the victims of the genocide.</p>
                <p>The memorial is located in Kigali and features a large stone structure with a simple design.</p>
                <p>The memorial is surrounded by a garden filled with trees and flowers, creating a peaceful atmosphere.</p>
                <p>Every year, the Rwandan people come together to commemorate the genocide with various events.</p>
                <p>The most popular event is the "Remembrance Day," where people gather at the memorial to pay their respects and honor the victims.</p>
                <p>Additionally, the Rwandans organize cultural events, exhibitions, and performances to preserve the memory of the genocide.</p>
                <p>These events help the Rwandan community to heal and move forward, and to ensure that the lessons of the genocide are never forgotten.</p>

                <h2>Why did we choose this topic?</h2>
                <p>Me and Rajveer chose this topic because we wanted to understand the impact of the Rwandan Genocide.</p>
                <p>First, we looked at the Holocaust. We believed that this was such a horrific event that it have been understood by the entire world as a tragedy that should never happen again.</p>
                <p>However, as we were researching, we realized that it did happen again, and again, and again, and we were shocked.</p>
                <p>The Rwandan Genocide was one that interested us, and so we decided to take a closer look at it.</p>
