                <h2>About the Rwandan Genocide</h2>
                <p>It's important to learn about the Rwandan Genocide for many reason, including honoring the victims but also to prevent future things like this from happening.
                    The genocide, also known as the Rwandan Massacre, was a time of a lot of murder and violence that happened in Rwanda from April to July 1994.</p>
                <p>The violence was started by the assassination of the Rwandan president Juv√©nal Habyarimana on April 6, 1994. The Hutu-led government of Rwanda blamed the Tutsis,
                    and started doing mass killings against them. Around 1 million people, mostly Tutsis and moderate Hutus, died because of this genocide.</p>
                <p>The genocide had a big impact on Rwanda and the world, showing the dangers of hatred between ethnic groups and what happens if big countries don't do anything to stop it.
                    Bigger countries weren't able to stop the genocide, mostly because they didn't do anything when they had the chance.</p>

                <h2>Our Discoveries</h2>
                <p>While researching, we found interesting information about the genocide and the part that other countries played in it.
                    When Rwanda was controlled by Belgium, the Belgians favored the Tutsis, which led to a deep divide between the Hutus and the Tutsis.
                    After Rwanda became independent from Belgium in 1962, there was still conflict between the 2 groups, whic all led up to the presiden't assassination in 1994 and the genocide that came after it.</p>
                <p>We also uncovered significant disputes involving France's role in the genocide. France has been accused of supporting the Hutu-led government during the massacre,
                    including providing military assistance and training to the Hutu forces responsible for the atrocities.
                    This controversial involvement remains a point of contention and discussion.</p>

            <section id="plan">
                <h2>Plan for the Memorial</h2>
                <p>To honor the victims of the Rwandan Genocide and educate future generations, we propose establishing "The Garden of Remembrance and Hope." This memorial will be a peaceful and reflective place designed to preserve the memory of the genocide and teach valuable lessons.</p>
                <p>The memorial will feature:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>VR Digital Exhibits:</strong> Personal experiences from survivors and victims will be told through virtual reality, creating an immersive and emotional view of the genocide.</li>
                    <li><strong>Memory Wall:</strong> A wall engraved with the names of the victims, humanizing the numbers and making the tragedy more meaningful.</li>
                    <li><strong>Education Center:</strong> A specialized place for workshops, talks, and educational programs on genocide, ethnic conflict, and global intervention. The center will offer seminars on international responses and issues, including France's suspected role.</li>
                    <li><strong>Virtual Journey:</strong> A digital platform to share stories and lessons from the Rwandan Genocide, raising awareness of the French debate and sparking worldwide reflections.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The new memorial will be located in Kigali, the capital city of Rwanda, and will cost approximately $20 million. It will serve as a symbol of hope and reconciliation, providing a physical space for the Rwandan community to commemorate the genocide, honor the victims, and work towards a brighter future.</p>
