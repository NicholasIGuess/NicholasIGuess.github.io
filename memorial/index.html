                <h2>About the Rwandan Genocide</h2>
                <p>Understanding the Rwandan Genocide is crucial not only for honoring its victims but also for learning vital lessons to prevent future atrocities. The genocide, also known as the Rwandan Massacre, was a period of ethnic violence and mass killings that took place in Rwanda from April to July 1994.</p>
                <p>The violence was sparked by the assassination of the Rwandan president, Juv√©nal Habyarimana, on April 6, 1994. The Hutu-led government of Rwanda blamed the Tutsi minority and launched a campaign of mass killings against them. An estimated 800,000 to 1 million people, mostly Tutsis and moderate Hutus, were killed during this period.</p>
                <p>The genocide had a profound impact on Rwanda and the world, highlighting the dangers of ethnic hatred and the consequences of international inaction. The international community largely failed to prevent the genocide, with many countries not acting when they had the opportunity.</p>

                <h2>Our Discoveries</h2>
                <p>Our research has revealed crucial information about the genocide and the role of international actors. Rwanda's history under Belgian colonial control worsened the divide between Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups, with the Belgians favoring the Tutsis. After independence in 1962, ethnic hostilities continued, culminating in the genocide following the president's assassination in 1994.</p>
                <p>We also uncovered significant disputes involving France's role in the genocide. France has been accused of supporting the Hutu-led government during the massacre, including providing military assistance and training to the Hutu forces responsible for the atrocities. This controversial involvement remains a point of contention and discussion.</p>

                <h2>Plan for the Memorial</h2>
                <p>To honor the victims of the Rwandan Genocide and educate future generations, we propose establishing "The Garden of Remembrance and Hope." This memorial will be a peaceful and reflective place designed to preserve the memory of the genocide and teach valuable lessons.</p>
                <p>The memorial will feature:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>VR Digital Exhibits:</strong> Personal experiences from survivors and victims will be told through virtual reality, creating an immersive and emotional view of the genocide.</li>
                    <li><strong>Memory Wall:</strong> A wall engraved with the names of the victims, humanizing the numbers and making the tragedy more meaningful.</li>
                    <li><strong>Education Center:</strong> A specialized place for workshops, talks, and educational programs on genocide, ethnic conflict, and global intervention. The center will offer seminars on international responses and issues, including France's suspected role.</li>
                    <li><strong>Virtual Journey:</strong> A digital platform to share stories and lessons from the Rwandan Genocide, raising awareness of the French debate and sparking worldwide reflections.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The new memorial will be located in Kigali, the capital city of Rwanda, and will cost approximately $20 million. It will serve as a symbol of hope and reconciliation, providing a physical space for the Rwandan community to commemorate the genocide, honor the victims, and work towards a brighter future.</p>
